vAmigaWeb
---------
vAmigaWeb is a progressive web app (PWA) - e.g. installable on iOS devices per save to home screen

vAmigaWeb is designed to run perfectly well not only on desktop but especially also on iPhones and iPads ... 
(also other touch devices like android should work well... in fact the lowest usable device in terms of processing perfomance is an iPadAir2 from 2014 with an A8 processor)
