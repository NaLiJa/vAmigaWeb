vAmigaWeb
---------
vAmigaWeb is a progressive web app (PWA) - e.g. installable on iOS devices per save to home screen

vAmigaWeb is designed to run perfectly well on iPhones and iPads in mind... 
(in fact the lowest usable device in terms of processing perfomance is an iPadAir2 from 2014 with an A8 processor)
